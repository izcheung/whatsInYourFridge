## Motivation

This project was mainly a way for me to practice and improve my JavaScript, jQuery, and web design skills. The problem I chose to focus on is one I often run into myself, which is letting food go to waste because I did not know how to use it with my existing ingredients. The app addresses this by helping users reduce waste by suggesting recipes based on the ingredients they already have.
